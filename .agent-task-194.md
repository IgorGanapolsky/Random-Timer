## Description
The current password generation algorithm could benefit from enhanced entropy sources and better character distribution to improve security.

## Proposed Solution
- Implement cryptographically secure random number generation
- Add configurable entropy sources
- Improve character distribution algorithms
- Add strength validation

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Replace Math.random() with crypto.getRandomValues()
- [ ] Implement configurable entropy pools
- [ ] Add password strength validation
- [ ] Update unit tests
- [ ] Performance benchmarks
