# Random Timer

Native Android (Kotlin/Compose) + iOS (Swift/SwiftUI) timer app. Package: `com.iganapolsky.randomtimer`.

## Commands

```bash
# Android
cd native-android && ./gradlew assembleDebug
adb reverse tcp:8081 tcp:8081    # Fix Metro connection

# iOS
cd native-ios && xcodebuild -scheme RandomTimer
cd native-ios && pod deintegrate && pod install  # Fix pod failures
```

## Non-Obvious Rules

- **Act, Don't Instruct**: NEVER tell user to run commands. Execute autonomously.
- **Named exports only**: No default exports.
- **Branch**: `develop` is main. Conventional commits.
- **Frontmatter dates**: Always use `date -u +"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ"`, never placeholders.
- **Frontmatter stripping**: Before GitHub sync: `sed '1,/^---$/d; 1,/^---$/d'`
- **Paths**: Always relative, never absolute. No usernames in paths.

## TDD Protocol (MANDATORY)

1. Write failing test FIRST
2. Run test — confirm it fails
3. Write minimal code to pass
4. Run test — confirm it passes
5. Refactor if needed

NEVER write production code without a failing test.

## Animation/Timing Parity Rule

When comparing animations across platforms (iOS/Android):
1. COMPUTE full cycle time for each platform in a table BEFORE proposing any fix
2. Android `RepeatMode.Reverse` = duration x 2. iOS `autoreverses: true` = duration x 2.
3. iOS cosine/sinusoidal `period` = full cycle time (NOT half-cycle)
4. Compare ALL visual elements between platforms before editing
5. Present timing comparison table BEFORE making edits

## PM Filesystem Convention

PRDs live in `.claude/prds/`, epics in `.claude/epics/`. Navigate with `ls`, `cat`, `grep` — no custom scripts needed. All `/pm:*` commands read the filesystem directly.
