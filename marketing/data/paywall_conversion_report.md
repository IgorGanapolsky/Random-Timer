## Data Quality Warnings
- unknown paywall entry_point is still receiving meaningful traffic
- settings_changed is still dominated by unknown setting_name rows in live data
- purchase failures are dominated by user_cancelled; prioritize pricing, plan default, and purchase-sheet value proof before assuming a store outage
- product catalog lookup failures detected; verify App Store Connect and Google Play product IDs, approval state, and cleared-for-sale status
