## What changed today
- Harden ASC screenshot readiness verification (#395)
- Fix iOS metadata sync on reused live version (#394)
- Improve iOS App Store creatives and ASO copy (#393)
- Store listing optimization + PostHog integration (#392)

## Inspiration
The core idea for Random Tactical Timer came from training principles in **Hard Target**:
https://www.amazon.com/Hard-Target-Become-Person-Predators/dp/B0F78ZL7ML

We translated that mindset into product behavior: unpredictable intervals, reduced anticipation, and repeatable high-focus drills.

## AI/LLM flow we used
We keep this loop tight: plan -> code -> test -> release gate -> feedback. The key is not bigger prompts, it's strict validation and fast iteration.

## Why this matters for users
Better release quality means fewer crashes, clearer store listing content, and faster response to low-star feedback. That directly improves trust and review quality.

## What we measure
- D1 and D7 retention from install cohorts
- Store conversion from listing views to installs
- Review velocity, star distribution, and unresolved low-star SLA
- Click-through rate on post CTAs to app download links

## Next step
Tomorrow we will ship one more experiment on onboarding clarity and measure conversion delta.
