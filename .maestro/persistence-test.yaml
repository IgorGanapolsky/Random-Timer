# Test: Verify settings persist between app launches

# First launch - don't clear state (dev build needs Metro connection)
- launchApp

# Wait for app to load
- waitForAnimationToEnd

- assertVisible: 'Random Timer'

# Find and interact with volume slider
# First, scroll down to ensure volume slider is visible
- scrollUntilVisible:
    element: '100%'
    direction: DOWN
    timeout: 5000

# Tap on the alarm card area to focus, then adjust volume
# The slider thumb should be near the right edge at 100%
- tapOn:
    point: '50%, 57%'

# Stop the app completely
- stopApp

# Relaunch
- launchApp

# Wait for app to load
- waitForAnimationToEnd

# Check that volume persisted (should not be 100% after tap moved it)
- assertVisible: 'Random Timer'
