        CVE-2025-55182 and CVE-2025-55184 affect React Server Components (RSC)
        which are used for server-side rendering in frameworks like Next.js.

        This is a React Native / Expo mobile application that runs entirely
        on the client-side (iOS/Android devices). React Server Components
        are not used and cannot be exploited in this context.

        The vulnerability requires:
        1. Server-side React rendering with RSC APIs
        2. HTTP requests to server endpoints running RSC

        Neither condition applies to a mobile app compiled for iOS/Android.
