            Review this React Native PR for Random Timer app. Be thorough and specific.

            CRITICAL CHECKS (fail the review if violated):
            1. SafeAreaView MUST be imported from 'react-native-safe-area-context', NOT 'react-native'
            2. MMKV MUST be imported from '@shared/utils/storage', NOT 'react-native-mmkv' directly
            3. Colors MUST use theme constants from '@shared/theme', NO hardcoded hex values
            4. New Redux slices MUST be added to persistConfig.whitelist in store.ts
            5. TypeScript strict mode compliance - no implicit any, no implicit returns

            STYLE CHECKS (suggest improvements):
            - Use spacing constants (spacing.xs, spacing.sm, etc.) instead of raw numbers
            - Functional components with hooks only (no class components)
            - Named exports preferred over default exports
            - useCallback for functions passed to children, useMemo for expensive computations

            SECURITY CHECKS:
            - No secrets, API keys, or credentials in code
            - No google-services.json or .env files committed

            Output format:
            - Start with overall assessment (APPROVE, REQUEST_CHANGES, or COMMENT)
            - List specific issues with file:line references
            - Provide fix suggestions for each issue

            ${{ github.event.comment.body }}

            Context: This is a React Native/Expo app (Random Timer) with:
            - TypeScript strict mode
            - Redux Toolkit + MMKV persistence
            - Dark-first glassmorphism theme
            - Path aliases: @navigation, @shared, @features, @assets

            Respond helpfully to their request. If they're asking for code changes,
            explain what needs to be done and where. Be specific with file paths.
